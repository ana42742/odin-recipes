    <div class="desc">
        <p>Margherita pizza is a simple, delicious pizza that’s easy to make at home. 
            What makes a Margherita special is just how brilliantly basic it is.
        </p>
        <p>The best versions feature mozzarella and parmesan cheese over a zesty tomato sauce, and include plenty of fresh basil.
            You can add tomato slices, too, for an extra pop of flavor.

            <li>3 cups whole wheat flour or 360 grams whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast or rapid rising yeast, 3 grams</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Toppings</em></h3>

            <li>½ cup Pizza Sauce or passata or marinara sauce</li>
            <li>200 grams fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>vegetarian parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>20 to 25 basil</li>

            <li>red chilli flakes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading">Steps</h2>
    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or in the bowl of a standing mixer with a hook attachment, add 1 teaspoon of instant yeast (3 grams) and ½ teaspoon of sugar.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of water and mix well.</li>
            <li>Next add 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Add 3 tablespoons of olive oil, or preferred flavorless oil.</li>
            <li>Plus add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Use the hook attachment of the standing mixture on medium speed to combine the ingredients and bring the dough together.</li>
            <li>The dough should be smooth, pliable and soft. If the dough looks dry, then you can add some water while kneading. If the dough seems sticky, sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough and continue to knead.</li>
            <li> Once combined, shape into a round ball within the bowl. Use your fingers to spread a light layer of water all over the dough.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a lid or a kitchen towel, and allow to rise until the dough increases in volume and doubles up. This should take about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough lightly again, and either use immediately or pack and store in the fridge or freezer.</li>
            <li>To make pizza with your homemade dough, first prepare a 9-inch pan or tray by lightly greasing with oil and dusting with flour, cornmeal, or semolina.
                Preheat the oven to its highest possible temperature. My oven has 250 degrees Celsius (475 degrees Fahrenheit) as the highest temperature.
                Allow the oven to preheat for 15 to 20 minutes before baking the pizza to make sure it’s perfectly hot.</li>
            <li> Separate the pizza dough into 6 or 7 even sections, packaging and storing any you’re not planning to use. To store, wrap each individual section in plastic wrap, and then seal all of the dough in an airtight plastic bag or other container.
                Working one pizza crust at a time, lightly flour a clean surface and sprinkle the dough with flour.
            </li>
            <li>Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a flat circle, about 0.5 centimeter or ¼ inch thick. Flour the rolling pin if it sticks, or use a piece of parchment paper between the dough and rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Carefully lift and place the dough into the greased baking or tray.</li>
            <li>Next, spread on a thin layer of store bought or homemade pizza sauce. Leave a good bit of room around the edge of the dough clear for the crust.</li>
            <li> Add a generous sprinkling of vegetarian parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>And top with lots of fresh mozzarella cheese. Spread out evenly, again, avoiding the very edge of the crust. Break fresh mozzarella cheese into chunks and place it on the crust.
            </li>
            <li>Move the baking rack or tray to the lowest position in your preheated oven. This will help create a wonderfully crispy crust. Place the pizza pan either on the rack or on the tray.</li>
            <li>Bake the Margherita pizza for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese is completely melted and the crust is lightly golden in color.</li>
            <li> Remove from the oven and top the pizza with some torn fresh basil leaves. You can also add a dash of dried oregano or red chili flakes, if you want.
            </li>
            <li>Use a pizza cutter or serrated knife to cut the Margherita pizza into 4 to 6 even slices.</li>
        </ol>
