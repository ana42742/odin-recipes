    <h2 class="subheading">Description</h2>
    <div class="desc">
        <p>These taste kind of like a mocha, in cookie form—what could be better than that for an afternoon or after dinner pick-me-up? 
        They’re soft and fudgy, and might even be better the day after they’re baked (if they last that long). 
        Feel free to reduce the amount of espresso in these if you or your family or friends are sensitive to caffeine.</p>

        <p>More of a <em>cafe au lait</em> person than a mocha fan? It’s true that instant coffee does go great with chocolate, but it’s also a fun addition to less chocolate-forward desserts too. 
            It adds a depth of flavor to chocolate chip cookies, blondies, and ice cream you’ll love.</p>

            <li>2 tbsp. whole milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>1 c. (2 sticks) butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 c. packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>

    <h2 class="subheading">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust racks to center and lower-third position and preheat oven to 350°. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. In a small bowl, combine espresso powder and milk and stir until dissolved. </li>  
      <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. </li>
      <li>In another large bowl, whisk together butter and sugar. Add eggs and whisk until lightened in color, about 2 minutes. Add espresso mixture and vanilla and whisk until combined. Add dry ingredients and stir until just a few dry streaks remain. Add chocolate chips and stir until just combined. Using a medium cookie scoop (about 3 tablespoons), scoop dough onto baking sheets about 2” apart. Top with flaky sea salt. </li> 
      <li>Bake until edges are just set, 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool completely.</li>  
    </ol>
